1. Both can be used both are same without js and with js -
import Header from "./components/Header"; // by default react treat it as javascript file only 
import Header from "./components/Header.js";

2. Two type of export 

default export - we can ony use one default export in a file .

export default componentname ;
export default RestaurantCard;

named export - 
use to export mutiple variables or constants 
add export infront of any variable or constants
export const CDN_URL ="test"

2. Two type of import

named import 
import {} from 'path';
import { CDN_URL } from "../utils/contants";

default import 
import resList from "../utils/mockdata";

3.React Hooks (normal JS utility function)
useState() - 
import { useState } from "react"; - import as named import


 const [listofRestaurants, setlistofRestaurents] = useState([])    []- defalt value which is assigned to listofRestaurants variable

setlistofRestaurents ()= function which updates the default value if any operation is done on this function

** whenever a state variable updates react re-render the component
 

useEffect()


4. Reconliation algorithm (react fiber) - 
virtual DOM is representation of actual DOM . virtual dom is normal js object

5.Diff Algo - it find the difference btwn updated virtual dom and previous virtual dom and update the actula virtual dom on every render cycle.

6. React is fast due to efficient DOM manupulation coz of virtual dom . It keeps the data layer and UI layer in syn.
