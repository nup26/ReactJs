How to create seperate bundle for grocery -

lazy loading -
when our homepage will load it will not load code for grocery . When we click only then it will load code for grocery .

In app.js we will not load grocery like this - import Grocery from "./components/Grocery";

lazy() - given by react library and will be import as named import . It take a callback function .
under it import takes the path of the component which we want to load lazy 

const Grocery = lazy(() => import("./components/Grocery"));

--> now in dist folder we have two js file on for whole app expect grocery and other one only for grocery .

-- > to fix the issue after lazy loading use Suspense component which is given by react lib .
-->Wrap your component in Suspense

   path: "/grocery",
        element: (
          <Suspense fallback={<h1>Loading....</h1>}>
            <Grocery />
          </Suspense>

here fallaback is given when we clicked on grocery it will take some time to load the code of that component until the code came for
time being we can show fallaback on the grocery page.

Here lazy loading - to make app to make it fast and performent . and use lazy loading to distribute the bundles into chunks .
