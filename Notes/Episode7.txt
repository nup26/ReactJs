1. If there is no dependency array in  useEffect() then UseEffect() will called eveerytime when component is rendered.
2.If the dependency array is blank then useEffect() is called only on intial render (just once)
3. If dependcy will have something then useEffect() will be called when that dependcy changes 
const fetchData = () => {
  console.log("use effect is called"),[btnNameReact]
    );
so whenever btnNameReact changes useEffect() will called.

4. Never create useState() in loops , in any conditions or in any function

Routing
Install npm library called react router dom
command - npm i react-router-dom

Import below in App.js
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";

and add code in App.js- 
const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <AppLayout />,
    errorElement: <Error />,
  },

  {
    path: "/about",
    element: <About />,
  },
  {
    path: "/contactus",
    element: <ContactUs />,
  },
]);


root.render(<RouterProvider router={appRouter} />);

5. for handling error path add errorElement: <Errorcomponent /> in appRouter
6. Feature react router dom give it to us access to a important hook for  error - useRouterError()
import { useRouteError } from "react-router-dom";

const Error = () => {
  const err = useRouteError();
  // console.log(err);
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Oops!!!</h1>
      <h2>Something went wrong</h2>
      <h3>
        {err.status} : {err.statusText} // can access this coz of useRouterError hook
      </h3>
    </div>
  );
};

7. How to make header intact - create children routes
About contactus are children of AppLayout
Outlet will be replaced as the children as the path changes 
when outlet will be replaced according to path where we are .like / path then header and body , /about then header and about

const AppLayout = () => {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <Header />
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
};

const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <AppLayout />,
    children: [
      {
        path: "/",
        element: <Body />,
      },

      {
        path: "/about",
        element: <About />,
      },
      {
        path: "/contactus",
        element: <ContactUs />,
      },
    ],
    errorElement: <Error />,
  },
]);

8. In react when you want to route to some other page then don't use anchor tag . When we click on any page using anchor tag it refersh whole page.
You can navigate to other page without reloading the whole page .
use link component from react router dom  . It works exactly same as anchor tag .
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
In anchor tag we have href in link component we have to for define the path where the page naviagte .
  <Link to="/about">About Us</Link>

Link changes the component via client side routing.That is why react application call as single page application.

9.Web applications have two types of routings -
a.Client side routing
b.Server side routing
