Q. difference between git and github -place where git is hosted

Not only react but other pacakage are also helping to make react fast 

npm - there is no full form of npm 
it manages the pacakages
It is the standard reepo for all the pacakges . All the pacakages are hosted over here . Libraries utilites comes from npm .
Npm manages it .

Steps-  
1. npm init     -(to add npm to our project)
   pacakge name:
   version:
   desrptn:
   entry point:
   test commnd:jest
   git repo:
   keyword:
   author:
   license:
   It is ok :yes
 -------------------
 after all this pacakge.json file is created in our project
 
 pacakage.json - it is configuration for npm

Bundler - it helps us to bundel our app together so that it can move to the production
eg - webpack , bable , parcel

2. npm install -D parcel -----(to install parcel in our app)

-----------
after this pacakage-lock json file is created , node modules is created and in pacakge.json dev dependency is added 

-D = to add parcel as dev dependency

types of dependency - 
dev dependency - it is required in development phase 
noram dependency- for production phase 

"parcel": "^2.11.0" => 
^ (caret) - it will intall the minor version . (mostly used) 
~ (tilde) - it will install the major version .

pacakage-lock.json - it keep a track of the extact version if all the dependency mentioned in pacakage.json file

"integrity": "sha512-H/RI1/DmuOkL8RuG/EpNPvtzrbF+7jA/R56ydEEm+lqFbYktKB4COR7JXdHkZXRgbSJyimrFB8d0r9+SaRnj0Q==", -- >
it maintain the code which is there on local and the code deployed on production .

node_module - conatains all the dependencies . 
all dependencies have its pacakage.json file . So in our project we don't have single pacakage.json fill .

Q. Sholud we put node_modules on production or git ? NO == > put it is .gitingore file.

.gitignore - contains those file which are not required to put on production or on git .

We can regenerate node_module using pacakage.json and pacakage-lock.json file  -- that why no need to push on pro or in git

npm install 


Q. Sholud we put pacakage.json and pacakage-lock.json file on gitgit ? YES coz it mainatain all the dependencies for our project

3. npx parcel index.html --- > buliding parcel  . Create dist and parcel cache folders

4. npm install react - to install react 

5. npm install react-dom or npm i react-dom  - to install react-dom
