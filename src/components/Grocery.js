        Grocery Store . Convenience stores belong to the grocery stores
        classification but they sell a limited line of goods, unlike
        supermarkets. While thereâ€™s an overlap of certain product categories
        between a supermarket and a convenience store, convenience stores tend
        to focus mainly on essential food items such as bread, milk, cheese and
        coffee, in addition to snacks, beverages and tobacco. As a result of
        that, convenience stores tend to be smaller in size than supermarkets.
